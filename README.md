Hand Gesture-Based Image Zoom Using MediaPipe & OpenCV! ✋📷

I built an AI-powered Image Zoom Controller that allows you to zoom in and out using just your hand gestures—no mouse or keyboard needed! 🎯

🔹 Tech Stack: Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe# install this pakage
🔹 How It Works:
✅ Detects hand movements using MediaPipe Hands
✅ Measures the distance between thumb & index finger
✅ Adjusts zoom level dynamically in real-time

This project showcases the power of Computer Vision in creating interactive, touchless experiences! 💡
